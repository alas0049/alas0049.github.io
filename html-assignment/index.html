<blockquote>"Flowers are an elegant language" <cite>Azhar</cite></blockquote>
<p>The word ‘Flowers’ has so many deep meanings in people’s lives such as Love, happiness, hope, forgiveness, and beauty. 
<em> My name is Azhar, which means flowers in Arabic</em>. <br> Therefore, I started introducing myself with the meaning of my name as I feel that my name describes many things about my personality.</p>

<p> I am 24 years old, I was born on 27 <sup>th</sup> April, 1995, originally from the country of Yemen and I have been living in this beautiful country (Canada) for four years.  My passion for designing made me pursue studies in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> despite this being a new challenge for me.  Additionally, I possess the curiosity and ambition to learn and better understand the world of Interactive Media, its relation to the internet, and coding.
